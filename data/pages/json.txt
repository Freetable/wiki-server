=====About=====
JSON (/ˈdʒeɪsɒn/ jah-soun, /ˈdʒeɪsən/ ja-son), or JavaScript Object Notation, is an open standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.
=====Where we use it=====
All inter application communication is in JSON format encapsulated in base 32 encoding.
=====Why we use it=====
JSON is very simple to read, debug, and decode.  Every major language has a built in JSON decoder and if the language of choosing does not it's very easy to parse using string manipulation commands.
