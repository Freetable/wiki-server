=====About=====
Percona Server is an enhanced, drop-in MySQLÂ® replacement which has been downloaded more than 700,000 times.

=====Where we use it=====
We use Percona Server and Percona XtraDB to link the network services together.  Each network service location has at least one of these.

=====Why we use it=====
Percona is basically a very tricked out version of MySQL that allows for high performance and many multi master replication.  Percona is still ACID complaint.

=====Notes=====
There are other alternatives that can be used here, but they all have trade offs.  Anything that can be considered as a replacement needs to be ACID compliant and support multi master replication.
