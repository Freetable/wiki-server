=====About=====
Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.
=====Where we use it=====
Freetable chat servers use Redis's publication/subscription feature to maintain consistent, real-time communication between chat nodes.
=====Why we use it=====
Redis's publication/subscription feature is very easy to use with event based code ( like Ruby Celluloid or EventMachine ) and websockets to provide very easy pseudo real time server to client communication that is event driven and not polling driven.
