=====About=====
Celluloid is a concurrent object oriented programming framework for Ruby which lets you build multithreaded programs out of concurrent objects just as easily as you build sequential programs out of regular objects

=====Where we use it=====
Celluloid is used for event based communication between the server and the client after page loads.
=====Why we use it=====
Celluloid allows for the use of Rubinius and true multi threading per process for Ruby because of the removal of the Global Interpreter Lock or the GIL for short.
