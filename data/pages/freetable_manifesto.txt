Freetable is an open source approach to a collaborative online music experience.  Freetable aims to be the perfect solution to starting your own online collaborative multi-media experience.  Freetable uses a central repository with synchronized files, profiles, and playlists.  Freetable has been designed from the beginning to support roaming profiles for users within a network.

Freetable is not a simple replacement for turntable.fm.  Freetable will have at least all the functionality of turntable.fm, but allow a lot more freedom over customization.  Freetable will allow you to roam different servers within a network without problem.  There will be simple default server templates that can be used to create the various pieces needed to setup a Freetable node, however, please adhere to the minimum requirements per node.  File servers not on stable pipes can act as poison for example.

The developers behind Freetable understand that we all come from very diverse walks of life, with an even more diverse array of hardware and software following us.  Freetable will always strive to use open source software, protocols, codecs, and standards whenever possible.  Freetable will always strive to support as many different devices as possible.  Our methods and practices are 100% open and we encourage anyone that thinks they have an idea to attempt it.
